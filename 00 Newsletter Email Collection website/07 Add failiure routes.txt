2) Add Post request for failiure route

app.post("failiure", function(req,res){
  res.redirect("/")
})


app.listen(3000, function(){
   console.log("Server is up and running on port 3000");
});
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Test this route

end up on failiure route -> click try again -> again back to sign up page

Post request triggered
to failiure route ----> Caught by server---->redirect to home route ----> home route triggers app.get  ------> sends signup.html page ---> render on screen
				     / res.redirect("/")
